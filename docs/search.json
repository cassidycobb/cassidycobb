    "text": "My passion for science as been present since I could read. Science classes were always my favorite, and I always loved going on field trips to the Denver Nature and Science Museum or the Denver Zoo. When I started my Bachelors degree at Black Hills State University in Spearfish, South Dakota, I declared my major to be Environmental Science and never changed it. I did end up pursuing a minor in Native American Studies, which quickly turned into a major and then became my second Bachelors degree. I have always been committed to preserving and contributing to the beautiful tribal cultures of North America. Black Hills State University offers an authentic opportunity to learn more about the history and culture of Native American tribes through their Bachelors in Native American Studies. I met some amazing people and gained more knowledge about traditional spiritual and environmental practices of the Lakota Nation. I also took a Lakota language class which is extremely necessary to maintain the language for generations to come.\n\n\n\nAbove is a picture of me and one of my professors, Dr. Jace Decory. Dr. Decory was an extremely influential person in my life during my undergrad years. She was a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and was a strong voice for the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, but also for all people. Throughout her career, she was involved in cultural curriculum development and Lakota language studies. One of my favorite classes I have ever taken was Ethnobotany of the Northern Plains, which Dr. Decory taught. We learned about plants of the Black Hills and their traditional uses. She was an instrumental figure in the community, and she will be missed dearly.\n\n  \n\nAbove are some pictures of me touring the Sanford Underground Research Laboratory in Lead, South Dakota in 2019. SURF is the deepest underground laboratory in the United States, and the second in the world. I descended in the Yates mineshaft to the lab level, which is 4,850 feet below the surface of the Earth. At SURF, they mainly focus on studying dark matter and neutrino physics. This was truly a once in a lifetime experience for me and further solidified my enthusiasm for science.\n\n\n\nFrom September 2023 to July 2024, I held a position at Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance where I contributed to inspiring communities to save wildlife for future generations. It was genuinely an incredible experience. Not only did I learn about a myriad of different species and their traditional homelands, but I had the privilege of relaying that information to guests of all ages and backgrounds. In this picture, I am feeding BB the female giraffe, who is expecting a calf to be born in March 2025!"

    "text": "During my first semester of my Masters program, which was Fall 2024, I have taken 3 courses that have strengthened my knowledge and technical abilities in the field of ecosystem science and sustainability.\n\n\n\nLand Use Hydrology (WR 416) has allowed me to develop a comprehensive understanding of hydrologic processes, including how water moves after precipitation and how human activities impact water pathways. This knowledge is applied to evaluate hydrologic responses across various land uses and climates, addressing challenges like flooding, droughts, and pollution. The focus is on supporting land management, ecosystem health, and designing sustainable infrastructure that minimizes environmental disruption.\n\n\n\nIn Introduction to Environmental Data Science (ESS 523A), I developed skills in file, code, and data management to analyze diverse datasets, applying techniques like linear regression and trend analysis to uncover patterns in environmental data. By determining the appropriate levels of analysis and code complexity, we could effectively address specific questions about the data. Using RStudio, we performed the data analysis and applied statistical techniques, while GitHub was utilized for version control, allowing us to manage code, files, and datasets efficiently and collaborate effectively, tracking changes and sharing work throughout the project.\n\n\n\nIntegrated Ecosystem/Sustainability Analysis (ESS 500) started off by collecting soil samples at Seaworth Farms in Wellington, Colorado. The process involved extracting vertical soil columns at specified depths, labeling the samples, and storing them in airtight containers to assess the impact of land use on soil quality over time. The soil was then dried and ground using sieves and ovens to ensure consistency in the samples. In the laboratory, carbon content and soil organic matter were measured using combustion methods, providing insights into the soil’s ability to store carbon and its role in climate change mitigation efforts.\n\n\n\nIn my undergraduate studies at Black Hills State University, I also completed multiple courses that are relevant to my career pursuit.\n\n\n\nIn Global Positioning & Geographic Information Systems (SCI 388), I created interactive maps to spatially visualize data by adding and styling layers, while navigating the ArcGIS software interface to use essential tools for map creation and management. Additionally, I collected data in the field using GPS devices and mobile GIS applications.\n\n\n\nGeneral Chemistry Lecture and Lab (CHEM 114, CHEM 114L) gave me a solid understanding of fundamental chemical principles through both theoretical and hands-on learning. In the lectures, I studied topics such as atomic structure, chemical bonding, thermodynamics, and reaction kinetics, which provided the foundation for the lab work. In the laboratory, I conducted experiments to apply these concepts, including performing titrations, measuring pH levels, synthesizing compounds, and analyzing reaction rates. Throughout the courses, I honed my skills in lab safety, accurate measurement, data analysis, and interpreting chemical phenomena, all while gaining a deeper appreciation for the role of chemistry in real-world applications.\n\n\n\nEthnobotany of the Northern Plains (AIS 377) was focused on Native American uses of traditional plants in the Black Hills region. We took trips into the Hills, discussed medicinal and practical applications of over 30 plants, and memorized their genuses and species in Latin and the Lakota language."

    "text": "Hello! My name is Cassidy Cobb and this is my Github website. I am currently a graduate student at Colorado State University! I am pursuing a Masters in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. I graduated in 2020 with a Bachelors in Environmental Science and a Bachelors in Native American Studies. When I graduate with my Masters in 2025, I hope to have gained relevant experience to begin my career in environmental science.\nI have always been passionate about doing my part to counteract anthropogenic climate change. Knowing that agriculture contributes to 20-30% of greenhouse gas emissions, I strive to make agriculture more regenerative for generations to come. Specifically, I would like to be a project manager for an urban agriculture organization in Colorado. Water resource conservation is also extremely important to me, so I would like to implement innovative water use ideas into agricultural practices."
