Hello! My name is Cassidy Cobb and this is my Github website. I am currently a graduate student at Colorado State University! I am pursuing a Masters in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. I graduated in 2020 with a Bachelors in Environmental Science and a Bachelors in Native American Studies. When I graduate with my Masters in 2025, I hope to have gained relevant experience to begin my career in environmental science.

I have always been passionate about doing my part to counteract anthropogenic climate change. Knowing that agriculture contributes to 20-30% of greenhouse gas emissions, I strive to make agriculture more regenerative for generations to come. Specifically, I would like to be a project manager for an urban agriculture organization in Colorado. Water resource conservation is also extremely important to me, so I would like to implement innovative water use ideas into agricultural practices.
